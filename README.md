# Welcome to My Subscribers App!
Project created to demonstrate some android apps development concepts. (personal)</br>
This project have goal to show how to build a CRUD using:</br>
- Kotlin language
- Good practices
- MVVM architecture
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Jetpack Room
- Jetpack Navigation component
- Jetpack LiveData.

# Project
This project make use some technologies requested by market to help in some scenarios that simulate day to day of a android developer

# Technologies
This project use the follow technologies and tools:
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - Create, store, and manage persistent data backed by a SQLite database.

- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle) - Build lifecycle-aware components that can adjust behavior based on the current lifecycle state of an activity or fragment.
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [Recyclerview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview?hl=pt-br) - Display large sets of data in your UI while minimizing memory usage.
- [Cardview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/cardview?hl=pt-br) - A FrameLayout with a rounded corner background and shadow.
- [MVVM Architecture](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-3-model-view-viewmodel-e7eeee76b73b) - Model-View-ViewModel Pattern.
